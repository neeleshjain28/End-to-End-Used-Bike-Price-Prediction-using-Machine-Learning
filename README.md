🚀 Used Bike Price Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the price of used bikes using machine learning techniques. The dataset was cleaned, processed, and transformed into a machine learning-ready format before training regression models.

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains features such as:

Bike Brand

Year

Kilometers Driven

Owner Type

Selling Price

🔍 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Cleaning

Removed null values

Handled duplicate records

Filtered inconsistent entries

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized price distribution

Analyzed relationship between features and price

3️⃣ Feature Engineering

Applied Label Encoding

Converted categorical data into numerical format

4️⃣ Model Building

Split dataset into training & testing sets

Applied regression algorithms

Evaluated performance using R² Score and MAE

📊 Model Performance

The regression model achieved good predictive performance on unseen test data.

🛠 Tech Stack

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-Learn

Jupyter Notebook

🚀 Future Improvements

Hyperparameter tuning

Trying advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
